      <h1>Our History</h1>

      <p>
        DataMite Technologies, LLC is a business that deals with Vibration and
        Acoustic Emission in rotating equipment. We know how to use these
        phenomena for detecting problems and squeezing the maximum lifetime out
        of replaceable parts before a shutdown.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our products reflect these fields of expertise, together with years of
        hands-on experience by key personnel in the manufacture, installation,
        and maintenance of rotating equipment. On the inside, our instruments
        use the latest advances in the state of the art. Nevertheless, on the
        outside, they are rugged, simple, and easy for anyone to use. As
        instrument-makers for fault detection by vibration and acoustics, we
        squarely support the men and women who use these products. We take pride
        in seeking new ways to make high technology practical and profitable for
        our customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        A constant stream of new products illustrates DataMite Technologies, LLC
        success in this regard, all of which we manufacture in the United
        States:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Shortly after the closely-held company was founded in 1998, we got the
          Centurion Instruments Line, a family of instruments known as the
          DataMite 1000 series. This is a tiny, portable unit carried on an
          operator&sbquo;s belt. Sensing with a hand-held probe, it displays two
          parameters whose trends show the condition of a bearing: the velocity
          of gross vibration, and the intensity of ultrasonic noise. They can
          also register surface temperature.
        </li>

        <li>
          For even faster, simpler, and more economical monitoring of vibration,
          there is the DataMite 2000 instrument. Touched to operating equipment,
          this miniature hand-held unit shows vibrational velocity in a
          simplified, multicolored bar display. A digital readout is also
          included.
        </li>

        <li>
          The newest arrival is the Model 7000-01 Bearing Analyzer that can
          separate large and small bearings into GOOD/BAD within seven seconds
          at various speeds, run times and alarms the operator.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        One reason for our customer&sbquo;s satisfaction is the rugged
        reliability that we build into every instrument. We are so confident in
        our quality that we provide guarantees for one or two years, covering
        repair labor and replacement parts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps equally important, our customers appreciate the personal
        attention that DataMite Technologies gives them. Although we are growing
        in a healthy fashion, we are still small enough to be exceedingly
        responsive. When a client telephones for help, he reaches a friend who
        knows his situation and is committed to his success.
      </p>

      <p>
        That, in brief, is the kind of company DataMite Technologies, LLCis. We
        are the kind of company that would appreciate the opportunity to serve
        you, and that will work to keep you on our growing list of satisfied
        users.
