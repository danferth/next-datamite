        DataMite Technologies, LLC is a business that deals with Vibration and
        Acoustic Emission in rotating equipment. We know how to use these
        phenomena for detecting problems and squeezing the maximum lifetime out
        of replaceable parts before a shutdown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our products reflect these fields of expertise, together with years of
        hands-on experience by key personnel in the manufacture, installation,
        and maintenance of rotating equipment. On the inside, our instruments
        use the latest advances in the state of the art. Nevertheless, on the
        outside, they are rugged, simple, and easy for anyone to use. As
        instrument-makers for fault detection by vibration and acoustics, we
        squarely support the men and women who use these products. We take pride
        in seeking new ways to make high technology practical and profitable for
        our customers.
